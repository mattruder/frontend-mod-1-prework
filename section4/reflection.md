## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

* It was tough to follow, I tend to work on things until they're done without distracting myself as an ADHD
coping mechanism.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

* I found myself more easily distracted with the 5 minute breaks, but I know it would be good for my mental health to do so.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

* An object is a 'thing' that is defined by a set of characteristics called properties, while Arrays create and store
lists of data in a single variable.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  array, because the students won't change
  * List of states and their capitals
  array, because the info is static
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  array, its a static list
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  object, as you will follow more accounts as time goes on
  * List of student names and their cohort
  object, multiple characteristics
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  object, multiple characteristics
  * All my favorite restaurants
  array

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

AirBNB; some keys are Location, CheckIn date, Check out date, guests. Example values: Dallas, TX; 07/26/21; Matt, Lindsey

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

I'm still a little confused on assigning a method to a class.
