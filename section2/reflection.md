## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

* I tend to wait before asking questions, but I believe that setting a timer for 20 minutes as soon as I get stuck is a great idea so I don't get too lost down the google search rabbit hole.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

* This was a great idea. Thankfully I had already written how to run the file in node down in my notebook so it wasn't too much trouble. It was uncomfortable because the terminal still feels like riding a bike without training wheels for the first time, but I feel much more comfortable with it now.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

* A conditional statement is a statement based on if-then-else. A daily life conditional: If I am awake then I am drinking coffee, else I am asleep and not drinking coffee. In a web application I use called Splice: if the user has enough credits, they can purchase the sound, else they cannot purchase the sound.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

* You can add multiple conditions to an if statement with if-else. The program reads straight down them, finds which one matches what the user entered into the parameter, and outputs the appropriate thing.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

* Logical AND operators can check if 2 conditions are met, and Logical OR operators can check if at least one condition is met.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

* I'm still not sure how this would physically be tied to a web application, but I'm sure that will be answered eventually.
