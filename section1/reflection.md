## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  * The superlearner article resonated with me in that I already do some of these habits that have carried over from the pursuit of getting really good at guitar.
  * I already view learning as a process, have a growth mindset, and take short breaks.
  * I would like to read more, though watching Youtube a lot helps with that too.
  * Having time set aside each day for the same goal is something I would add to this list.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

  * Number - they're numbers! All numbers, negative and decimals. Decimals are referrred to as floating point numbers.
  * String - its basically text, all letters and other characters wrapped within quotes. single or double quotes work.
    - Numbers wrapped in quotes are also a string.
  * Boolean - evaluates if something is true or false. Helpful when you want to ask the program a question.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Code comments add extra detail when it either isn't obvious or would be convenient to have.
//Double backslashes comment out a line.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable stores data. For a 5 year old, I would say: "A variable could be types of fruit. Apple, banana, orange, etc."

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I use Splice frequently. Three variables could be:

  1. Does the username/password match what is in the system? (Boolean)
  2. How many credits does the user have? (Number)
  3. What is the name of each available sound? (String)

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is used to combine two or more strings/data types/variables into one string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

Spotify blend playlists likely use concatenation to create a playlist that blends two user's algorithms and displays them
into a playlist. If that doesn't work, AirBNB definitely uses it in their search feature.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

My question so far is that how is this linked to a website. I know a user could enter data into variables, but how would you
code an empty variable? So how do you write code that allows a user to enter the data rather than running it in atom.
I'm sure we'll get there eventually, I just don't have a super clear mental picture of how it all ties together yet.
