## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

Seeking out challenges and understanding that mistakes are part of growth resonated with me.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I currently demonstrate a growth mindset in music, but not so much in coding yet. I'm excited to apply myself harder to coding once I get in the swing of things.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I use Splice regularly. They use arrays to display each sound a user has downloaded.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a way of interacting with an array. You can add elements to an array, or remove them, or any
number of other things.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to check a condition. If the condition returns true, a code block will run.
We use a loop in conjunction with an array if you need to run code for each element of an array.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop is like making cookies, adding sprinkles to every cookie until you have done every cookie.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
